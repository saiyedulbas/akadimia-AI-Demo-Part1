        political_events: `
        The political events of the 1st century in terms of the political offices and institutions in Rome during the Republican period
was designed to prevent any individual from becoming powerful. Between the fifth and first centuries BCE, Rome became
the center of the world's most powerful empire. In summary the main following factors encompasses an overview of the first
century.
1. A military expansion fueled economic development, bringing slaves and loot back to Rome.
2. Roman political institutions reflected Roman society's in two classes: patricians and plebeians. Plebeian access to
higher office was granted between 494 and 287 BCE. The Plebeian Council abolished the requirement that
proposed laws be approved by patrician senators before they could be considered by the Plebeian Council. Under
the new arrangements, some plebeians gained power and wealth, but many remained impoverished.
3. The Romans did not devise a deliberate strategy for establishing an empire. Instead, Rome grew as it clashed with
neighboring city-states, kingdoms, and empires. Most conquered enemies were granted Roman citizenship,
sometimes with full voting rights, in exchange for military service.
4. They also started minting coins, which became the standard unit of currency for the majority of the time. Their
network of commercial and political contacts grew in tandem with their political clout.
5. The Romans attempted to strike a balance between granting governors sufficient power to control their provinces
and preventing governors from becoming so powerful that they could challenge Rome's authority.
6. As Rome became the most powerful state in the world by the first century BCE, it expanded through military power,
political flexibility and economic expansion. Like all ancient societies, Rome's economy was based on agriculture,
which was incredibly labor-intensive.`,
tech_advancements: `By the first century BCE, Rome had become the most powerful state in the world, expanding through military power, political
flexibility, and economic expansion. When it comes to technology, the emergence of the water mill is too gradual to be
pinpointed. It could be the evolution of a new type of water wheel. A vertical wheel with attached jugs can also be used to
raise water by scooping it up at the bottom and pouring it out at the top. Water wheels powered by oxen or camels, for
example, are still used in many parts of the world today. They could have been a forerunner of the water mill, in which the
process is reversed, with water turning the wheel and power transferred in the opposite direction along the axle . The
Romans adopted the Greek water mill, and in the first century BCE, Vitruvius provided the first written account of a geared
water wheel. <br> The widespread and effective use of water power is a technological achievement of the Middle Ages. An arch or dome that
has been bonded into solid form by a strong inner layer of concrete sits as a single unit, exerting its weight downwards
rather than outwards. To make this possible a surveying instrument must somehow maintain both planes consistently in
different places, to take readings of the deviation in each plane between one location and another.`,
famine_and_natural_disasters: `The Lydia earthquake in 17 AD destroyed at least twelve cities in the Lydia region of the Roman province of Asia in Asia
Minor (now part of Turkey). Tacitus and Pliny the Elder, Roman historians, and Strabo and Eusebius, Greek historians, all
recorded the earthquake. Pliny referred to it as "the greatest earthquake in human memory" (Nat. Hist. 2:86 200). The city of
Sardis, the former capital of the Lydian Empire, was the hardest hit and never fully recovered.
Pompeii, Italian Pompei, a well-preserved ancient Roman city in Campania, Italy, 14 miles (23 kilometers) southeast of
Naples, at the southeastern base of Mount Vesuvius. A massive eruption from Mount Vesuvius spewed volcanic debris over
the city of Pompeii around noon on August 24, 79 CE, followed the next day by clouds of blisteringly hot gases. Buildings
were destroyed, people were crushed or asphyxiated, and the city was buried beneath an ash and pumice blanket. Pompeii
slept for centuries beneath its pall of ash, which perfectly preserved the remains. On the other side, Luke uses the Greek
word oikoumene to describe a severe famine that will engulf the entire "Roman world." It means "inhabited world," and it is
commonly used to refer to the Roman Empire, Orbis Terrarum in Latin.
There are no records of a single famine ravaging the entire empire during Claudius' reign. Secular historians, on the other
hand, provide strong evidence that widespread famines occurred during his reign. Agabus could be referring to a series of
famines that would occur at different times throughout the empire. The Roman Empire as a whole is suffering from famine.
Several Roman historians mention crop failures and famine conditions during Claudius' reign. Josephus writes of a severe
famine that hits Judea in what is thought to be about A.D. 45-47.`,

        period:"101-200 A.D.", 
        political_events: `In the 2nd Century, the civic units which were led by devoted local aristocracies, served as the foundation of Roman rule
        throughout the empire. Each was governed by a town council (curia), which was presided over by elected magistrates. They
        were in charge of resolving local disputes and collecting taxes from the populace in the vast surrounding territory and
        remitting them to the state.
        The local aristocracies were left to their own devices as long as they were outwardly Roman in their values and met the tax
        demands of Roman officials. Surprisingly, this sometimes required them to make up a shortfall in the anticipated level of
        taxation from their territory. The system was notoriously prone to abuse: tax collectors' greed and corruption played a role in
        the Boudiccan revolt back in 60 AD. There was a chasm between those privileged to hold Roman citizenship and the
        non-citizen majority in the early empire (peregrini).
        However, citizenship gradually spread, and in AD 212 it was granted to almost all free inhabitants of the empire, recognizing
        Rome as a world empire rather than a city. To meet the needs of the times, the system of government and taxation changed
        dramatically in the late empire. Following AD 300, the imperial government became much more authoritarian, with a large
        bureaucracy of officials where there had previously been very few. Tax collection was still done through the cities, but it was
        now mostly done in kind, allowing supplies to be sent directly to the frontier army.`,
        tech_advancements: `Vast networks of Roman roads, the empire's arterial system, was largely built by legions of soldiers. These highways had
        complex technological undertakings, the amount of labor required was enormous. By the 2nd century AD, the network had
        spread around the Mediterranean and throughout Europe, all the way up to the Danube, the Rhine, and northern England.
        The development of these three architectural forms was the greatest achievement of Roman architecture and technology.
        The arch, vault, and dome are all variations on the same theme. The development of concrete greatly aided the Roman
        achievement in all of these forms. This enables marvels like the 1st-century Pont du Gard and the 2nd-century Pantheon to
        be built.
        Another invention is a cofferdam, a watertight sheath within which a bridge foundation can be built in the bed of a river. To
        achieve a watertight seal, the Romans pioneered this technology by driving two circles of wooden piles into the river and
        then packing the space between them with clay. The river bed's water and mud are scooped out of the resulting cylinder,
        allowing a concrete foundation for the pier to be built on firm ground. The arches of the Sant'Angelo bridge are still
        supported by foundations dug in the Tiber nearly 1900 years ago.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `The Antioch earthquake struck on December 13, 115 AD. It was estimated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.5 and a
        maximum intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Antioch and the surrounding areas were devastated, with
        many people killed and property destroyed. It caused a local tsunami, which severely damaged Caesarea Maritima's harbor.
        Trajan, the Roman Emperor, and his successor Hadrian were both caught in the earthquake. Despite the death of consul
        Marcus Pedo Vergilianus, they escaped with only minor injuries and later began a rebuilding program for the city. The Mcurn
        earthquake that happened in 139 AD is recorded in seismological bibliographical records as having occurred in Mcurn
        (modern Hösnek, Turkey). According to reports, the earthquake occurred near Mount Ararat. The region corresponded to
        eastern areas of modern Turkey and was part of the historic Kingdom of Armenia. The work of historian Movses Khorenatsi
        is a primary source for the earthquake (5th century).
        The 141 Lycia earthquake occurred in the period AD 141 to 142. It affected most of the Roman provinces of Lycia and Caria
        and the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Simi, and Serifos. It triggered a severe tsunami which caused major inundation. The
        epicenter for this earthquake is not well constrained, with locations suggested at the northern end of Rhodes, on the Turkish
        mainland north of Rhodes near Marmaris, and beneath the sea to the east of Rhodes.
        The Hatepe eruption, named for the Hatepe Plinian pumice tephra layer, also known as the Taupo eruption, was Taupo
        Volcano's most recent major eruption, and it occurred between 180 and 233 CE. It is thought to be the largest eruption in
        New Zealand in the last 20,000 years. The eruption ejected 120 km3 (29 cu mi) of material, 30 km3 (7.2 cu mi) of which was
        ejected in a matter of minutes.
        The Antonine Plague of 165-180 AD, also known as the Plague of Galen (after the doctor who described it), decimated the
        Roman Empire. It was brought to Rome by armies returning from western Asia, causing fevers, skin sores, diarrhea, and
        sore throats. The information that was provided by Galen does not unambiguously identify the nature of the disease, but
        scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.`,

            political_events: `The 3rd Century is about the Byzantine Empire, southeastern and southern Europe, and western Asia were all part of the
            Byzantine Empire. It started as the city of Byzantium, which grew from an ancient Greek colony established on the European
            side of the Bosporus.
            Constantine conquered the city in 330 CE and renamed it Constantinople. At the time, the region was known as the Eastern
            Roman Empire. The western half of the Roman Empire ended with the fall of Rome in 476, while the eastern half continued
            as the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople as its capital.
            The eastern realm differed from the western realm in many ways: it was more commercial and urban, heir to Hellenistic
            civilization. Justinian (r. 527–565), its greatest emperor, reconquered some of western Europe, built the Hagia Sophia, and
            issued the basic codification of Roman law. The empire was weakened after his death. Though its rulers continued to refer
            to themselves as "Roman" long after Justinian's death, "Byzantine" describes the medieval empire more accurately. The
            eastern church's long controversy over iconoclasm prepared it for the break with the Roman church.`,
        tech_advancements: `The creation of Knitting is a very simple concept, but it is extremely difficult to visualize. As a result, it is one of the few
        technological developments in ancient history to have an actual inventor. Transforming a continuous thread into a piece of
        fabric without ever cutting the thread still appears difficult as a challenge to the inventive mind.
        Knitting appears for the first time in the Roman Empire, in the third century AD. Socks (found in Egyptian tombs) are the
        earliest examples to survive, and it is in footwear that the benefits of new technology are most obvious. Until now, feet were
        typically kept warm and protected within shoes by wrapping them in strips of cloth or leather. The Romans invented the
        tailored sock, which is made of pieces of cloth sewn together, in the second century AD.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `In the year 262, or possibly 261, the 262 Southwest Anatolia earthquake devastated the Roman city of Ephesus as well as
        cities along Anatolia's west and south coasts. The epicenter was most likely in the Aegean Sea's south. According to
        reports, many cities were flooded by the sea, presumably as a result of a tsunami. The source of most literary references to
        this quake, according to Nicholas Ambraseys, who performed the most comprehensive assessment of ancient earthquakes
        in the Mediterranean, is an account in the Augustan History purportedly written by Trebellius Pollio.
        Around Easter 250 CE, the Cyprian Plague erupted in Ethiopia. It arrived in Rome the following year, then spread to Greece
        and further east to Syria. The plague lasted nearly 20 years and reportedly killed up to 5,000 people per day in Rome at its
        peak.
        The constant warfare confronting the empire as a result of a series of border attacks: Germanic tribes invading Gaul and
        Parthians attacking Mesopotamia contributed to the rapid spread of sickness and death. Drought, floods, and famine
        depleted the population while the empire was rocked by turmoil. St. Cyprian (200-258 CE), bishop of Carthage, remarked
        that the world appeared to be coming to an end.`,    
    period:"201-300 A.D.", 
    description: `The Crisis of the Third Century, also known as Military Anarchy or the Imperial Crisis (235–284 AD), was a period in which the Roman Empire nearly collapsed. It ended due to the military victories of Aurelian and with the ascension of Diocletian and his implementation of reforms in 284, including the Tetrarchy. The crisis began in 235 with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops. During the following 50-year period, the Empire saw the combined pressures of barbarian invasions and migrations into the Roman territory, civil wars, peasant rebellions and political instability, with multiple usurpers competing for power. This led to the Plague of Cyprian, debasement of currency and economic collapse. Roman troops became more reliant over time on the growing influence of the barbarian mercenaries known as foederati. Roman commanders in the field, although nominally working for Rome, became increasingly independent. By 268, the empire had split into three competing states: the Gallic Empire (including the Roman provinces of Gaul, Britannia and, briefly, Hispania); the Palmyrene Empire (including the eastern provinces of Syria Palaestina and Aegyptus); and, between them, the Italian-centered Roman Empire proper.There were at least 26 claimants to the title of emperor, mostly prominent Roman army generals, who assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire. The same number of men became accepted by the Roman Senate as emperor during this period and so became legitimate emperors. Later, Aurelian (270–275 AD) reunited the empire militarily. The crisis ended with Diocletian and his restructuring of Roman imperial government in 284. This helped to stabilize the Empire economically and militarily for another 150 years. The crisis resulted in such profound changes in the empire's institutions, society, economic life, and religion that it is increasingly seen by most historians as defining the transition between the historical periods of classical antiquity and late antiquity.`},

            political_events: `In the 4th Century the magistri militum was the highest-ranking general of the late Roman imperial army. Emperor
            Constantine created this office in the early part of the fourth century intending to reduce the chance that generals would
            threaten the reigns of his sons and dynastic heirs. This was initially a success, and the magistri militum competently served
            the whims of the emperors for many decades. They commanded the imperial armies in war, they were involved in asserting
            the religious will of the emperors, and their schemes were limited to low-level politicking.
            However, the magistri began to resist the dominance of the emperors, and the role of the magistri changed through certain
            decisive moments over the course of the late fourth century. Instances such as the magister Merobaudes raising a
            four-year-old child as a puppet emperor under his control, or when Arbogast refused an order of dismissal from the same
            emperor. The final decisive moment of the fourth century was Stilicho’s appointment as guardian and protector of the
            emperor Honorius. These events dramatically changed the political sphere of the western Empire, which would continue to
            be dominated by generals until the dissolution of imperial control in Western Europe.
            This phenomenon will be compared to different but concurrent developments in the Eastern Empire, which contrastingly
            resulted in the dilution of military power instead of the supremacy of civil officials. On the other side, The Italian city of
            Aquileia held a special role during its entire history both in the economic and political framework of the Roman Empire. Its
            significance is well attested to by many different kinds of sources — literary, epigraphical, archeological, iconographical, and
            numismatic, which help to draw a complete and consistent picture of the political, economic, and social conditions.`,

        The earthquake is described in The Life of Saint Nerses, a hagiography (8th century). The story depicts the destruction of
        the city of Arsakawan, which was built by King Arshak II (reigned 350-368). According to reports, the city's collapse crushed
        all of its inhabitants. All that remained of the city was "wood and stone debris."

        Gulf of Aqaba.
        The 365 Crete earthquake struck the Eastern Mediterranean around sunrise on July 21, 365, with an assumed epicenter
        near Crete. Geologists today estimate the undersea earthquake to have been a magnitude 8.5 or higher. It caused
        widespread destruction in the central and southern Diocese of Macedonia (modern Greece), Africa Proconsularis (northern
        Libya), Egypt, Cyprus, Sicily, and Hispania (Spain). The earthquake was followed by a tsunami that devastated the

    description: `The 4th century was the time period which lasted from 301 (CCCI) through 400 (CD). In the West, the early part of the century was shaped by Constantine the Great, who became the first Roman emperor to adopt Christianity. Gaining sole reign of the empire, he is also noted for re-establishing a single imperial capital, choosing the site of ancient Byzantium in 330 (over the current capitals, which had effectively been changed by Diocletian's reforms to Milan in the West, and Nicomedeia in the East) to build the city soon called Nova Roma (New Rome); it was later renamed Constantinople in his honor. The last emperor to control both the eastern and western halves of the empire was Theodosius I. As the century progressed after his death, it became increasingly apparent that the empire had changed in many ways since the time of Augustus. The two emperor system originally established by Diocletian in the previous century fell into regular practice, and the east continued to grow in importance as a centre of trade and imperial power, while Rome itself diminished greatly in importance due to its location far from potential trouble spots, like Central Europe and the East. Late in the century Christianity became the official state religion, and the empire's old pagan culture began to disappear.[citation needed] General prosperity was felt throughout this period, but recurring invasions by Germanic tribes plagued the empire from 376 CE onward. These early invasions marked the beginning of the end for the Western Roman Empire. In China, the Jin dynasty, which had united the nation prior in 280, began to quickly face troubles by the start of the century due to political infighting, which led to the opportunistic insurrections of the northern barbarian tribes (starting the Sixteen Kingdoms period), which quickly overwhelmed the empire, forcing the Jin court to retreat and entrench itself in the south past the Yangtze river, starting what is known as the Eastern Jin dynasty around 317. Towards the end of the century, Emperor of the Former Qin, Fu Jiān, united the north under his banner, and planned to conquer the Jin dynasty in the south, so as to finally reunite the land, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Fei River in 383, causing massive unrest and civil war in his empire, thereby leading to the fall of the Former Qin, and the continued existence of the Eastern Jin dynasty.`},

            Political philosophy as a genre was invented by Plato during this period and effectively reinvented by Aristotle: it includes
            reflections on the origins of political institutions, concepts used to interpret and organize political life such as justice and

            political_events: `The sixth century B.C. has been regarded as a definite starting point of the political history of ancient India. From that time, it
            has been possible to construct a continuous account of India's political developments. There were a large number of
            monarchical states in India in the 6th century B.C. While many of them were ruled by weaker kings, a few of them saw the
            rise of a strong monarchy. Notable among the powerful kingdoms in the north were Avanti, Vatsa, Kosala, and Magadha.
            The 6th century began, in effect, with Anastasius' death and the accession of the Balkan soldier who succeeded him, Justin I
            (ruled 518–527). During the majority of Justin's reign, actual power was held by his nephew and successor, Justinian I. The
            following account of Justinian's effective rule is based on the works of Justinian's contemporary, the historian Procopius. In
            his Polemon (Wars), the latter wrote a laudatory account of the emperor's military achievements, which he paired with a
            venomous threefold attack on the emperor's personal life, the character of the empress Theodora, and the conduct of the
            empire's internal administration in his Anecdota (Secret History).
            Justinian's reign can be divided into three periods: (1) an initial age of conquest and cultural achievement lasting until the
            540s; (2) a decade of crisis and near-disaster during the 540s; and (3) the last decade of the reign, during which mood,

            one example of the civilizing spell that Constantinople frequently cast on the heirs of those who ventured within its walls.
            Justin, the uncle, was a rude and illiterate soldier; Justinian, the nephew, was a cultivated gentleman, adept at theology, a
            powerful builder of churches, and a supporter of Roman law codification.
            All of those achievements are, in the most literal sense, civil, and it is easy to forget that Justinian's empire was almost
            constantly at war during his reign. East Rome's history during that period exemplifies, in classical fashion, how the impact of
            war can transform ideas and institutions alike.`,

        famine_and_natural_disasters: `The volcanic winter of 536 was the most severe and long-lasting episode of climatic cooling in the Northern Hemisphere in
        the last 2,000 years. The volcanic winter was caused by an eruption, with several possible locations proposed on different
        continents. Although the impact of the cooler temperatures extended beyond Europe, most contemporary accounts of the
        volcanic winter are from authors in Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Modern research has
        determined that the eruption ejected massive amounts of sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere in early 536 (or possibly late
        535), reducing solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface and cooling the atmosphere for several years.
        Constantinople began to experience darker skies and cooler temperatures in March 536. Summer temperatures in 536 were
        up to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) lower than normal in Europe. The lingering effects of the 536 volcanic
        winter were exacerbated in 539–540 when another volcanic eruption caused summer temperatures in Europe to drop as
        much as 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) below normal.
        There is evidence of yet another volcanic eruption in 547, which would have extended the cooler period. The volcanic
        eruptions, which began in 541 and were accompanied by the Plague of Justinian, caused crop failures, famine, and millions
        of deaths, triggering the Late Antique Little Ice Age, which lasted from 536 to 660. According to medieval scholar Michael
        McCormick, 536 was the worst year in history to be alive. "It was the start of one of the worst years of my life, if not the worst

From the upheaval the Franks rose to prominence and carved out a sizeable domain covering much of modern France and Germany. Meanwhile, the surviving Eastern Roman Empire began to expand under Emperor Justinian, who recaptured North Africa from the Vandals and attempted fully to recover Italy as well, in the hope of reinstating Roman control over the lands once ruled by the Western Roman Empire. In its second Golden Age, the Sassanid Empire reached the peak of its power under Khosrau I in the 6th century.

            Catholic Church rose to become the most powerful institution of the Middle Ages. The Church's alliances and protection
            provided a great deal of power to kings, queens, and other leaders. In 800 CE, for example, Pope Leo III designated the
            Frankish king Charlemagne as "Emperor of the Romans"–the first such designation since the fall of the Roman Empire more
            than 300 years before. Over time, Charlemagne's realm evolved into the Holy Roman Empire, one of several European
            political entities whose interests tended to align with those of the Church. Ordinary people in Europe were required to "tithe"
            10% of their annual earnings to the Church; at the same time, the Church was mostly exempt from taxation. These policies

            Political upheaval was common in imperial China during dynastic transitions. Multiple regional regimes frequently arose on
            the former unified empire's lands, vying for political and military supremacy until a dominant power emerged and reunified

        sources of power and a cultural "machine-mindedness," both of which were incorporated into a wide range of economic

        Europeans began to breed both the specialized warhorse, which now had stirrups to give the mounted warrior a better seat
        and more striking power, and the draft horse, which was now shod with iron horseshoes to protect the hooves from the
        damp clay soils of northern Europe. The draft horse was more efficient and faster than the traditional beast of burden, the
        ox. The innovation of the new horse collar in the 10th century, a device that pulled from the horse's shoulders rather than its
        neck and windpipe, greatly increased the animal's pulling power.
        Chiao Wei-yo, an engineer working on the great Chinese canal system in the 10th century AD, is credited with developing

        about 200 yards apart. He realizes he has created a pool that will be located at either the upper or lower level of the canal
        depending on which of the two barriers is open. Furthermore, the barrier that separates patches of level water can be
        opened without being obstructed by water pressure.
        Some method of dealing with differences in water level is required from the beginning of canal construction. The most basic
        solution is a weir, which holds up the water on the higher side and has a gap in the middle that can be opened to allow a
        boat to pass through. The removal of the barrier, however accomplished, is invariably followed by a sudden rush of water,
        which carries the vessel easily through one direction while making passage extremely difficult in the other. For obvious
        reasons, a primitive lock of this type is known as a flash lock.`,

        as the Early Medieval Pandemic). Early Middle Ages economic, medical, and social historians have occasionally devoted a
        few words to the 569–570 non bubonic epidemic, the spread (or dormancy) of malaria, and the supposedly non-Yersinia
        plagues reported in early Irish annals. Similarly, palaeo pathologists and palaeo microbiologists have paid sporadic attention
        to chronic, often nonlethal, but endemic early medieval infections like leprosy, malaria, and tuberculosis. Non-Justinianic

        Trade gradually revived, revitalizing not only the city but also the city-state in Italy, the Rhineland, and the Low Countries,
        because newly prosperous burghers could now afford to build strong walls around their towns, making it difficult for the
        nobility to successfully besiege them. Even the peasants occasionally made their presence felt in bloody uprisings, and the
        nobility was far from a homogeneous or united class. It was a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of political arrangements; to
        the extent that it ever settled down, it did so on the principle that, because everyone's claim to power and property was
        fragile and inconsistent with everyone else's, a certain amount of mutual forbearance was required. This explains why

        what John Watts has characterized as the making of polities' in later medieval Europe. These changes, one could argue, are
        also related to the growing bureaucracy and formalization of the Roman Church in the aftermath of the reforms of the tenth
        and, especially, the eleventh centuries.`,

        The two-field system was used by medieval farmers, but another system was being developed at the same time. In medieval
        Europe, three fields could be used to grow food around each village. The first section contains a spring crop, such as barley
        or oats, the second section contains a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third section contains an off-field that is left
        alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock. By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the
        off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops. This system improves agricultural productivity
        over the two-field system by utilizing only one-third of the field instead of half. Another advantage of crop rotation is that
        many scholars believe it has increased yields by up to 50%.`,

        of the victims of the 17th October 1091 London Tornado.The tornado ripped through the city's heart, causing extensive
        damage. The church of St Mary-le-Bow was completely leveled, with four massive 26-foot rafters driven so deep into the
        earth that only four feet were visible above ground. Many more structures, including around 600 mostly wooden houses,
        were also demolished, even though only two people were killed. This was the first tornado recorded in British history.
        Meteorologists estimate that this tornado would have rated T8 on the tornado scale, which ranges from T1 to T10. Winds of
        up to 240 mph would have hit the city if this were the case. William Rufus rebuilt the bridge after the tornado, but it was
        short-lived as a fire destroyed it only 40 years later. Following that, the bridge was rebuilt in stone.

        William the Conqueror in the winter of 1069–70 to subjugate northern England, where the presence of the last Wessex
        claimant, Edgar Atheling, had sparked Anglo-Danish rebellions. William paid the Danes to return home, but the remaining
        rebels refused to fight him, so he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires with scorched earth

Christendom experienced a formal schism in this century which had been developing over previous centuries between the Roman West and Byzantine East, causing a split in its two largest denominations to this day: Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. In Northern Italy, a growth of population in urban centers gave rise to early organized capitalism and more sophisticated, commercialized culture by the late 11th century. In East Europe, there was the golden age for the principality of Kievan Rus.n In Song dynasty China and the classical Islamic world, this century marked the high point for both classical Chinese civilization, science and technology, and classical Islamic science, philosophy, technology and literature. Rival political factions at the Song dynasty court created strife amongst the leading statesmen and ministers of the empire. The Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, the Ghaznavids, and the Chola dynasty in India had reached their zenith in military might and international influence. The Western Chalukya Empire (the Chola's rival) also rose to power by the end of the century.`},

        known as medieval philosophy. Even among medievalists, there is no agreement on when this
        period begins or ends; however, it is conventional—and probably neither fully correct nor
        incorrect—to begin with, Augustine (354–430), and to note that the influence of medieval
        philosophy continued even after the birth of Descartes (1596–1650). Medieval political
        philosophy is the branch of medieval philosophy concerned with politics. Philosophical writing
        about politics during the middle ages (as well as the early modern period) was frequently an
        attempt to influence public events, and the subject's history thus includes references to those
        events. It also includes references to developments in medieval culture, such as the
        renaissance of the ninth and twelfth centuries, as well as the growth of institutions such as the
        legal system and universities. The strong relationship between philosophy and religion during
        this period further complicates the story. These "extra-philosophical" connections are one of the
        reasons why political philosophy developed so rapidly during the Middle Ages, as religious and
        political thinking was influenced by cultural developments and the stress of events. The focus of
        this article is on theologians and philosophers of the Latin Middle Ages, and it is organized
        chronologically.`,

        from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the Islamic world, China, and India

        antecedents. The revolutionary aspect was frequently found not in the act of invention itself, but
        its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though the
        Chinese invented gunpowder and other weapons, it was the Europeans who developed and
        perfected their military potential, paving the way for European expansion and eventual

            political_events: `Throughout this century, the Italian peninsula has been marked by political fragmentation. While
            the north experiences rapid urbanization, resulting in the formation of city-states, Sicily and the
            south are ruled by successive monarchies. Territorial and power struggle between the Holy
            Roman Empire, the papacy, and the northern and central peninsula city-states preclude
            domination by a central authority from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries. The Italian
            peninsula was divided into numerous autonomous states with a wide range of political
            institutions and legal structures in the 1200s, which was especially visible in the relationships
            between city-states and surrounding territories. (For example, Florence, which had the most
            political and financial power, controlled a relatively small region and was constantly at odds with
            neighbors such as Arezzo, Pistoia, Lucca, Pisa, and Siena.) Indeed, areas of influence and
            jurisdiction frequently overlapped in the same centers. Even the smallest social groups had their
            own distinct identity and degree of autonomy. Furthermore, each political entity tended to
            establish its institutions and act cooperatively with or aggressively against other groups.
            Because of the extreme complexities of such relationships, extrapolating any general
            socio-political reality of thirteenth-century Italian city-states as a whole is difficult. There were
            numerous wars and skirmishes between city-states, individual factions, and feudal powers. The
            parties vying for power centers frequently tended toward mutual annihilation: losers were exiled,
            their goods confiscated, and their homes destroyed; but in exile, to reclaim their power, they
            formed alliances with parties from neighboring cities and waged war against their fatherland.
            Such behavior resulted in a never-ending cycle of violence and cruelty. It is thought that the
            Chinese invented black powder in the ninth century. A few hundred years later, around 1250,
            Chinese innovators invented a gun or firearm for use as a signaling and celebration device, and
            it remained that way for hundreds of years.`,

        invention of the verge escapement, which enabled the first mechanical clocks in Europe around
        1280, was a significant step forward. A verge escapement is a mechanism in a mechanical
        clock that controls the rate of the gear train by allowing it to advance at regular intervals or ticks.
        Archeologists discovered the first recorded use of windmills in 1219 in China. Windmills were
        originally used to power grain mills and water pumps. Following the Crusades, the concept of
        the windmill spread to Europe. The earliest European designs, dating back to 1270. These mills
        typically had four blades mounted on a central post. They used a cog and ring gear to convert
        the horizontal motion of the central shaft into vertical motion for the grindstone or wheel, which
        was then used to pump water or grind grain. The convergence of these improvements in later
        Middle Ages ships, along with other improvements in construction and equipment—such as
        better barrels for carrying water, more reliable ropes, sails, and anchors, the availability of
        navigational charts (first recorded in use onboard ship in 1270), and the astrolabe (for
        measuring the angle of the Sun or a star above the horizon)—lend confidence to adventurous
        mariners and thus directly led to the voyages of dissent.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `The Samalas volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok erupted catastrophically in 1257. The
        eruption had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7,[a], making it one of the largest in the
        current Holocene epoch. It left behind a large caldera, which now houses Lake Segara Anak.
        Later volcanic activity in the caldera created more volcanic centers, including the active Barujari
        cone. The event produced tens of kilometers-high eruption columns and pyroclastic flows that
        buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighboring island of Sumbawa. The

        The Kanki famine (, Kanki no kikin), also known as the Kangi famine, was a famine that struck
        Japan during the Kamakura period. The famine is thought to have started in 1230 and lasted
        until 1231. It was named after the Kangi era (1229–1232), during Emperor Go-reign. Horikawa's
        Kuj Yoritsune was Japan's shogun. The famine was severe throughout Japan. It was caused by
        cold weather, most likely caused by volcanic eruptions, followed by a general breakdown of
        society. The unusually cold weather began in 1229, resulting in a food shortage. As a result of
        the excessive rains, cold spells, and blizzards that destroyed crops in July 1230, the shortage
        turned into famine, and people began to die in large numbers in September 1230. The lack of
        sunlight and cold was so severe that winter clothing was required in the spring and summer.
        Relief efforts by the Emperor and Shogunate were generally ineffective, as no food was
        available. Human trafficking was legalized in 1231 as a means of easing population mobility in
        the worst-affected areas, along with confiscations and forced food distribution. The social order
        crumbled, and marauding robber bands (including former Buddhist monks) became common.
        The conflict spilled over into Goryeo, as starving Kyushu residents raided coastal towns for
        food. The weather turned warm in the winter of 1230-1231, resulting in crop failure once again
        in 1231, this time due to a lack of soil moisture and a scarcity of seeds. Overall, approximately
        one-third of Japan's population perished (dead numbered 1,500,000-2,000,000), implying that
        the Kanki famine was possibly the worst in Japanese history. The great famine struck Kievan

        Prior to the invention of rudders, boats and large ships were maneuvered with oars or
        quarter-rudders. Quarter-rudders were mounted on the sides of ships, as opposed to modern
        rudders, which are mounted on the stern. They were used to limit the size of ships. The
        pintle-and-gudgeon rudder was a hinge device that allowed the rudder to be mounted on the
        stern, but it took a change in hull design, as well as the appearance of the full-rigged ship,

These two events played key roles in the development of the Renaissance.n The Roman Papacy was split in two parts in Europe for decades (the so-called Western Schism), until the Council of Constance.

Islamic Spain (Al-Andalus) became dissolved through the Christian Reconquista, followed by the forced conversions and the Muslim rebellion,[4] ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule and returning Spain, Portugal and Southern France to Christian rulers.`},

            political_events: `Humanism, originally an Italian phenomenon, became an important aspect of Western
            European political culture during the 16th-century Reformation. Political thought during the
            Reformation era was initially dominated by bellicose figures such as Luther, Calvin, and Loyola,
            even as embattled French Calvinists developed theories of political resistance and German and
            Dutch Anabaptists championed voluntary religion, pacifism, and the separation of church and
            state. Many political thinkers sought an order in a new absolutist vision of a powerful centralized
            state in response to the apparent intractability of religious conflict. Self-styled absolutist
            monarchs made even more ambitious and unbounded claims to power in the 17th century and
            in France. Such claims, however, were not uncontested. In England, the Stuart dynasty's
            apparent encroaching absolutism sparked a twenty-year conflict between royalists and
            parliamentarians, culminating in the trial and execution of Charles I and the sudden urgency of
            arguments for the community of goods, sexual freedom, and religious toleration by radical
            political groups such as the Ranters, Levellers, and Fifth Monarchists. Concurrent with and
            frequently intersecting with these political upheavals were the European discoveries of the New
            World, the enslavement of Central and South America's indigenous peoples, and the
            establishment of trading colonies in the Americas, which resulted in the reinterpretation of
            ancient theories of slavery and empire, as well as the emergence of international law by thinkers
            such as Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf.`,

            soaked in saltpeter and when it was lit it smoldered). To ignite the gunpowder, the slow match
            was touched to it. The Wheelock, on the other hand, was invented in the early 16th century. A
            metal wheel spun against a piece of iron pyrites, causing sparks to fly and ignite the gunpowder.
            As a result, most cavalry units abandoned the use of lances. Instead, they carried two or three
            loaded pistols and sabers.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `There were a lot of disasters that happened in this period and one of these was the Grand
        Harbour of Malta tornado. The Grand Harbour of Malta tornado was a powerful tornado that
        struck the Grand Harbour of Malta on September 23, 1555. At least four of the Order's galleys,
        named Santa Fè, San Michele, San Filippo, and San Claudio, capsized in the tornado, which
        began as a waterspout and killed at least 600 people. And when it comes to the 16th-century
        health disasters, we have “The Famine of the 1590s in Northern Italy”.Italy, precipitated by
        several years of bad weather at a time of particularly acute population pressure on available
        resources. Their failure fueled a general "system shock" for Northern Italy's social, economic,
        and demographic structures, resulting in protest, violence, and general social and economic
        disorder. The article refers to a large database of demographic time series to determine which
        areas were hardest hit by the famine. It then focuses on the Emilia-Romagna region before
        providing a case study of the rural town of Nonantola, for which rare data on age at death during
        the famine is used. According to an article, the 1590s famine was not solely the result of a
        combination of climate, agrarian technology, and demographic density, but was a complex
        "human failure" that can only be fully understood by taking institutions, culture, social and
        economic behavior, and even psychological factors into account. Before the arrival of
        Europeans, smallpox was an unknown disease not only in Mexico, but throughout the Americas.
        The Spanish introduced it to Mexican lands, and it played a significant role in the Aztec Empire's
        demise. In 1519, Hernán Cortés left Cuba for Mexico, where he was assigned to establish trade
        relations only on the Veracruz coast. He disobeyed the Cuban governor, however, and began an
        invasion of the mainland. The governor dispatched Pánfilo de Narváez to pursue Cortés.
        Narvaez's forces had at least one active case of smallpox, and by the time the Narvaez
        expedition arrived in Cozumel and Veracruz in 1520, the disease had established itself in the
        region.`,

The Renaissance in Italy and Europe saw the emergence of important artists, authors and scientists, and led to the foundation of important subjects which include accounting and political science. Copernicus proposed the heliocentric universe, which was met with strong resistance, and Tycho Brahe refuted the theory of celestial spheres through observational measurement of the 1572 appearance of a Milky Way supernova. These events directly challenged the long-held notion of an immutable universe supported by Ptolemy and Aristotle, and led to major revolutions in astronomy and science. Galileo Galilei became a champion of the new sciences, invented the first thermometer and made substantial contributions in the fields of physics and astronomy, becoming a major figure in the Scientific Revolution. n In the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire continued to expand, with the Sultan taking the title of Caliph, while dealing with a resurgent Persia. Iran and Iraq were caught by a major popularity of the Shiite sect of Islam under the rule of the Safavid dynasty of warrior-mystics, providing grounds for a Persia independent of the majority-Sunni Muslim world. n In the Indian subcontinent, following the defeat of the Delhi Sultanate empire and Vijayanagara Empire, new powers emerged, the Suri Empire founded by Sher Shah Suri, Deccan sultanates and the Mughal Empire[2] by Emperor Babur of Mughal Dynasty, a direct descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan.[3] His successors Humayun and Akbar, enlarged the empire to include most of South Asia. The empire developed a strong and stable economy in the world, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture, which significantly influenced the course of Indian history.`},

            political_events: `The 17th century in England was a time of great political and social upheaval, marked by civil
            war and regicide. Matthew White introduces the major events of this period, from Charles I's
            coronation to the Glorious Revolution more than 60 years later. The 17th century saw massive
            political and social upheaval. From an era defined by the Crown's tight control over the state,
            the century witnessed years of war, terror, and bloodshed that engulfed the kingdom, as well as
            Charles I's execution and the establishment of a republic. All of this was to be undone with the
            restoration of Charles II: a brief return to autocratic royal influence that was eventually swept
            away with the installation of William and Mary as ruling monarchs. Hugo Grotius's De Jure Belli
            et Pacis (1625; On the Law of War and Peace) was a plea for the spirit of law in international
            relations, and it helped shape European identity. It gained substance through the work of the
            great congresses (beginning with those of Münster and Osnabrück before the Peace of
            Westphalia in 1648) that met not only to determine rights and borders, taking into account battle
            verdicts and state resources but also to settle larger questions of justice and religion. By 1700,
            statesmen were speaking of Europe as a common interest to be defended against the ambitions
            of individual states. Descartes did not write only for Frenchmen, nor Leibniz only for Germans,
            when they wrote about the great issues of faith, morals, politics, and, increasingly, science. The
            use of Latin as a language of diplomacy and scholarship, as well as the pervasiveness of
            Roman law alongside local systems and customs, were two manifestations of Christendom's
            unity.`,
        tech_advancements: `Technology advanced rapidly in the 17th century. Hans Lippershey invented the telescope in
        1608, which had a significant impact on astronomy. The adding machine was invented in 1642
        by Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). The barometer was invented in 1643 by Evangelista Torricelli
        (1608-1647). Otto von Guericke invented the air pump in 1650. Meanwhile, a lot of effort was
        put into improving weapons. Firearms in the early 17th century were either matchlocks or wheel
        locks. When the trigger was pulled, a matchlock held a slow-burning match, which was touched
        to the powder. A metal wheel spun against iron pyrites, creating sparks, using a wheel lock.
        Both of these were gradually replaced during the 17th century by the flintlock, which worked by
        striking a piece of flint and creating steel-making sparks. Furthermore, the cartridge was
        invented in the early 17th century. The musket ball was placed in a container containing the
        necessary amount of gunpowder to fire it. The soldier no longer had to measure powder into his
        gun with a powder horn.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `One of the natural disasters of the 17th century was the California flood of 1605 was a massive
        flood that submerged much of modern-day California. The megaflood was caused by a series of
        heavy rainstorms across the region, which were exacerbated by an unusually powerful
        atmospheric river. The flooding had an impact on California's indigenous peoples, particularly
        those living in pre-industrialized populations. In addition to this event, geologic evidence
        suggests that other "megafloods" occurred in the California region in the years A.D. 212, 440,
        603, 1029, and c. 1300, 1418, 1750, 1810, and 1861–62. According to sediment research
        conducted by the US Geological Survey, the 1605 flood deposited a layer of silt two inches thick
        in the Santa Barbara basin, indicating that it was the worst flood event in the past 2,000 years,
        being at least 50% more powerful than any other recorded based on geological evidence. The
        US Geological Survey has created a hypothetical scenario called the "ARkStorm" that would
        occur if a similar event occurred in modern-day California. Another period of famine swept
        across Europe around the year 1620. These famines were generally less severe than the
        famines of twenty-five years before, but they were still severe in many areas. The great famine
        in Finland in 1696, possibly the worst since 1600, killed one-third of the population. Harvest
        failures devastated the northern Italian economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not fully recover
        for centuries. Northern Italy experienced severe famines in the late-1640s and less severe
        famines in the 1670s. Between 1693 and 1710, two famines in France killed over two million
        people. Both famines were exacerbated by ongoing conflicts. Illustration of starvation in
        northern Sweden during the 1867–1869 Swedish famine. Famine struck Scotland as late as the
        1690s, reducing the population of parts of the country by at least 15%. The Great Famine of
        1695–1697 may have killed a third of Finland's population and approximately 10% of Norway's
        population. As a result of a series of crop failures, death rates in Scandinavia rose between
        1740 and 1800. The Finnish famine of 1866–1868, for example, killed 15% of the population.
        The Italian Plague of 1629–1631, also known as the Great Plague of Milan, was a component of
        the second plague pandemic, which began with the Black Death in 1348 and lasted until the
        18th century. It was one of two major outbreaks in Italy during the 17th century, affecting
        northern and central Italy and killing at least 280,000 people, with some estimating as many as
        one million, or roughly 35 percent of the population. The plague may have contributed to Italy's
        economic decline in comparison to other Western European countries.`,

The greatest military conflicts were the Thirty Years' War,[1] the Great Turkish War, Mughal–Safavid Wars (Mughal–Safavid War (1622–23), Mughal–Safavid War (1649–53)), Anglo-Mughal Indian War, and the Dutch–Portuguese War. It was during this period also that European colonization of the Americas began in earnest, including the exploitation of the silver deposits, which resulted in bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe. n From the middle decades of the 17th century, European politics were increasingly dominated by the Kingdom of France of Louis XIV, where royal power was solidified domestically in the civil war of the Fronde. The semi-feudal territorial French nobility was weakened and subjugated to the power of an absolute monarchy through the reinvention of the Palace of Versailles from a hunting lodge to a gilded prison, in which a greatly expanded royal court could be more easily kept under surveillance. With domestic peace assured, Louis XIV caused the borders of France to be expanded. It was during this century that the English monarch became a symbolic figurehead and Parliament was the dominant force in government – a contrast to most of Europe, in particular France. n By the end of the century, Europeans were aware of logarithms, electricity, the telescope and microscope, calculus, universal gravitation, Newton's Laws of Motion, air pressure and calculating machines due to the work of the first scientists of the Scientific Revolution, including Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, René Descartes, Pierre Fermat, Blaise Pascal, Robert Boyle, Christiaan Huygens, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

        famine_and_natural_disasters: `Earthquakes, famines, and tidal waves. According to a new book edited by a UC Davis English
        professor, these were known as "dreadful visits" in the 18th century, and people's reactions to
        them were remarkably similar to today. "People generally think of disasters as freak events that
        are unlikely to affect them; they're optimistic about their chances of surviving or missing the big
        one," says Alessa Johns, editor of "Dreadful Visitations: Confronting Natural Catastrophe in the
        Age of Enlightenment," published by Routledge this fall. It's difficult to tell which era Johns is
        referring to. Consider this passage from her book: "Despite their experience of repeated
        earthquakes and knowledge of architectural theories explaining safer building methods... They
        at first built squat structures following the earthquake of 1693, only to succumb over the years to
        constructing edifices higher and closer together... erecting domes and towers." "In the 18th
        century, people heard sermons about the messages of these disasters and how their behavior
        needed to be changed; today, I believe, the messages people read are not religious, and far
        fewer people interpret them that way." Other UC Davis scholars contribute essays to the book,
        including history professor Charles Walker, who discusses earthquakes in South America, and
        history professor Alan Taylor, who writes about famine on the American frontier in 1789. The
        years 1740–1743 saw cold winters and summer droughts, resulting in famine across Europe
        and a significant increase in mortality. The winter of 1740–41 was unusually cold, which could
        have been caused by volcanic activity.
        According to Scott and Duncan (2002), "between AD 1500 and 1700, Eastern Europe
        experienced more than 150 recorded famines, and Russia experienced 100 hunger years and
        121 famine years." The Great Famine, which lasted from 1770 to 1771, killed approximately
        one-tenth of the Czech lands' population, or 250,000 people, and radicalized countrysides,
        sparking peasant uprisings. From 1451 to 1767, Northern Italy experienced sixteen good
        harvests and 111 famine years. The Persian plague epidemic of 1772–1773, also known simply
        as the Persian Plague, was a massive outbreak of plague, specifically Bubonic plague, in the

        also known as the Great Galveston hurricane and the Galveston Flood, and known regionally as
        the Great Storm of 1900 or the 1900 Storm, was the deadliest natural disaster in United States
        history and the fifth-deadliest Atlantic hurricane, trailing only Hurricane Mitch overall. The
        majority of these fatalities occurred in and around Galveston, Texas, after the storm surge
        inundated the coastline with 8 to 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7 meters) of water. In addition to the deaths,
        the storm destroyed approximately 7,000 buildings of all types in Galveston, including 3,636
        demolished homes; every dwelling in the city suffered some damage.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `Since the turn of the century, natural disasters have caused more than $7 trillion in economic
        damage and killed over 8 million people, according to figures calculated and compiled by risk
        engineer Dr. James Daniell of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). His database
        CATDAT examines socioeconomic indicators as well as collecting and evaluating socio
        economic loss data over time, and has created a massive foundation for his post-disaster risk
        model, which assists governments and aid organizations with disaster management and
        assessing the scale of a disaster quickly. James will present his findings at the 2016 General
        Assembly of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna. Furthermore, the modern era has
        seen the emergence of new infections. The ability of 'germs' to cause suffering and death is best
        illustrated by the discovery of GRID (gay-related immune deficiency) and then AIDS in the
        United States in the early 1980s (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). Early symptoms
        included fever and sweating, wasting and weakness, a rare type of tumor (Kaposi's sarcoma),
        and infections with organisms that are not normally dangerous to humans. The syndrome was
        quickly discovered in Haiti, among intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs, and its rapid
        spread caused concern around the world. The virus, now known as Human Immunodeficiency
        Virus (HIV), was discovered independently by two groups in 1983. The virus was almost
        certainly first discovered in Africa in the early twentieth century, when chimp meat infected with
        Simian Immunodeficiency Virus was consumed. It smoldered in humans for decades until
        changing social conditions sparked an epidemic that spread from Africa to Haiti and then to the
        United States. HIV has entered the modern disease landscape. HIV, like several other infectious
        diseases, including syphilis, has progressed from an acute to a chronic disease as the germ and
        the human body have grown accustomed to each other. As the most studied virus in history, it
        has resulted in novel drug therapies, but because it is so unpredictable, a vaccine has remained
        elusive. HIV is not the only 'emerging' disease to have emerged in the last half-century: Ebola
        virus, West Nile fever, Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, coronavirus, and SARS (Severe
        Acute Respiratory Syndrome) are all part of our modern world.`,    
    period:"1901-2000 A.D.", 
    description: `The 20th (twentieth) century began on January 1, 1901 (MCMI), and ended on December 31, 2000 (MM).[1] The 20th century was dominated by significant events that defined the era: Spanish flu pandemic, World War I and World War II, nuclear weapons, nuclear power and space exploration, nationalism and decolonization, technological advances, and the Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts. The 20th century saw a massive transformation of the world order: global total fertility rates, sea level rise, and ecological collapses increased; the resulting competition for land and dwindling resources accelerated deforestation, water depletion, and the mass extinction of many of the world's species and decline in the population of others; consequences which are now being dealt with. Man-made global warming increased the risk of extreme weather conditions. Additional themes include intergovernmental organizations and cultural homogenization through developments in emerging transportation and communications technology; poverty reduction and world population growth, awareness of environmental degradation, ecological extinction; and the birth of the Digital Revolution. Automobiles, airplanes and the use of home appliances became common, as did video and audio recording. Great advances in power generation, communication, and medical technology allowed for near-instantaneous worldwide computer communication and genetic modification of life. The repercussions of the World Wars, Cold War, and globalization crafted a world where people are more united than any previous time in human history, as exemplified by the establishment of international law, international aid, and the United Nations. The Marshall Plan—which spent $13 billion ($100 billion in 2019 U.S. dollars)[4] to rebuild the economies of post-war nations—launched "Pax Americana". Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union created enormous tensions around the world which manifested in various armed proxy regional conflicts and the omnipresent danger of nuclear proliferation. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 after the collapse of its European alliance was heralded by the West as the end of communism, though by the century's end roughly one in six people on Earth lived under communist rule, mostly in China which was rapidly rising as an economic and geopolitical power.`},

            political_events: `By the early twenty-first century, it had expanded to include nearly all of the states between the
            Russian border and the Atlantic Ocean. Though its overall constitutional structure remained
            weak, and agreement on how to sufficiently strengthen it appeared elusive, the EU's common
            laws and policies played a significant role in the lives of its citizens. The forces of
            Euroskepticism, on the other hand, were never completely defeated, and they won a significant
            victory in 2016 when British voters approved a referendum calling for the country's withdrawal
            from the EU. However, Western democracy faces additional challenges that may prove
            insurmountable. The great experiment of European imperialism has long since failed, but its
            legacy of corruption, war, and poverty, particularly in Africa, appeared to be even more difficult
            at the start of the twenty-first century than it had been 50 years before. Nationalism, nativism,
            and xenophobia continue to distort voters' judgments on foreign policy, just as greed misleads
            them on economic policy. Rather than being resolved, class conflicts have been muffled.
            Demagogues are as prevalent today as they were in ancient Athens. The incompatible claims of
            the city-states ruined ancient Greece, and modern civilization may still be jeopardized by the
            competing claims of nation-states. However, one thing is certain: if human beings, as political
            animals, are to progress further, they must continue to seek new forms of government to meet
            the ever-changing needs of their times.`,
        tech_advancements: `In the twenty-first century, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown an upward trend of
        growth (from 2000 to 2015). AI evolution has accelerated the advancement of human society in
        our time, with dramatic revolutions shaped by both theories and techniques. However, due to its
        multidisciplinary and fast-growing nature, AI is a difficult field to comprehend. We discover that
        the area is undergoing sustainable development, and its impact is growing. In terms of
        reference behavior, the decrease in self-references suggests that AI is becoming more
        open-minded. Artificial intelligence (AI) is doing a lot of good and will continue to provide many
        benefits to our modern world, but there will inevitably be some negative consequences. The
        sooner we start thinking about what those might be, the better prepared we will be to mitigate
        and manage the risks. Cryptocurrencies were an academic concept ten years ago, largely
        unknown to the general public. With the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, all of this changed. Most
        people are aware of cryptocurrencies these days, even if they are unfamiliar with how the
        system works. Governments and large corporations are now closely monitoring the
        cryptocurrency market in order to determine how they can adapt the transaction mechanism,
        specifically blockchain technology, to exchange value. Many businesses have launched
        blockchain projects to assess the viability of incorporating this technology into their operations.
        Whereas the Internet we know connects people all over the world and facilitates data exchange,
        experts believe blockchain technology is a different kind of internet: the internet of value. Our
        society is becoming increasingly digitally oriented. Financial service providers, in particular, are
        investigating the cryptocurrency model to determine how they can provide secure services in a
        more efficient and cost-effective manner. Before we look at the potential growth of the
        cryptocurrency market, let's take a look at how it all began. The world has seen the rise of social
        media, smartphones, self-driving cars, and autonomous flying vehicles since the turn of the
        millennium. Huge advances have also been made in energy storage, artificial intelligence, and
        medical science. Men and women have completed the mapping of the human genome and are
        grappling with the implications of biotechnology and gene editing.`,
        famine_and_natural_disasters: `The Indian Ocean Earthquake, also known as the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, was
        estimated to have a magnitude of 9.15. While the earthquake lasted only 10 seconds, it caused
        a tsunami that killed 2,00,000-3,10,000 people along the shores of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, South
        India, and Thailand, with one death even occurring at Port Elizabeth in South Africa, 8,000 miles
        away from the epicenter. There were a lot of serious disasters that happened in this century like
        The 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake, the 2003 European Heat Wave, etc.
        Famine killed nearly 75 million people in the twentieth century, but it has all but vanished in
        recent decades. It has reappeared, all of a sudden. South Sudan declared famine in late
        February, and famine warnings have recently been issued for Somalia, Nigeria, and Yemen.
        Furthermore, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWSNET), a US government-funded
        organization founded in 1985 specifically to forecast famines and humanitarian emergencies,
        estimated in January that 70 million people affected by conflicts or disasters around the world
        will require food assistance in 2017. In just the last two years, this figure has risen by nearly
        50%. Maybe the latest and worst epidemic that happened in this century is The Covid-19
        outbreak. The pandemic's economic and social impact is devastating: tens of millions of people
        are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, and the number of undernourished people, which is
        currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could rise by up to 132 million by the end of the year.`,
